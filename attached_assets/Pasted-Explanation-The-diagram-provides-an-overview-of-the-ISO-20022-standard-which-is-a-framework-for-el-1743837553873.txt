Explanation: The diagram provides an overview of the ISO 20022 standard, which is a framework for electronic data interchange between financial institutions. Here's a breakdown of the key components and flow: 1. **Introduction to ISO 20022**: It starts with the understanding that financial institutions have their own sets of data objects (step B). 2. **Standardizing Messages**: These data objects are grouped into "syntax-neutral" message models (step C). Once a model is created, it needs to be converted into a message format using certain syntaxes like XML or ASN.1 (steps D and E). 3. **Eight Parts of ISO 20022**: There are eight parts to this standard (step F), which include: - Metamodel (F1) - UML profile (F2) - Modelling (F3) - XML schema generation (F4) - Reverse engineering (F5) - Message transport characteristics (F6) - Registration (F7) - ASN.1 generation (F8) 4. **Financial Repository**: ISO 20022 acts as a full framework or repository (step G) that includes various elements such as a data dictionary, business concepts, message concepts, and types, as well as a business process catalog and transaction models (steps G1 to G8). 5. **ISO 20022 Recipe**: The process for developing and registering ISO 20022 messages is carefully defined (step H). This process involves identifying activities, engaging business and technical experts, and maintaining a repository on the ISO 20022 website (steps H1 to H7). 6. **Compliance at Model Level**: There is a focus on particular areas like card payments and payment clearing & settlement (step I). Compliance involves using a repository that includes a dictionary and a catalog of models, which result in ISO 20022 message models in different syntaxes (XML, ASN.1) and their physical message representations (steps I1 to I10). Overall, the diagram shows how ISO 20022 standardizes financial communications by offering a structured process to create and maintain message formats that can be universally understood, ensuring interoperability across different systems.
