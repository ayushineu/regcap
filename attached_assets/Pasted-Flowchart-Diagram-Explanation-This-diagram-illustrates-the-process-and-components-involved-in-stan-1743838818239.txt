Flowchart Diagram
Explanation: This diagram illustrates the process and components involved in standardizing financial messages using ISO 20022, a standard framework. 1. **Institutions (A)** - Financial institutions begin with their own sets of data objects. 2. **Data Transformation (B -> C -> D)** - These individual data objects are first turned into syntax-neutral message models (C), which are then standardized into common data objects by ISO (D). 3. **ISO 20022 Standard (ISO_20022_Parts)** - The standard consists of eight parts covering everything from the metamodel, UML profile, and modeling, to XML schema generation, reverse engineering, message transport characteristics, registration, and ASN.1 generation. 4. **From Models to Messages (D -> E -> F & G)**: - The standardized objects become ISO 20022 message models (E). - These models are then used to create the ISO 20022 Dictionary (F) and message schemas in XML or ASN.1 formats (G). 5. **Financial Repository (Financial_Repository)** - This repository stores key components necessary for financial transactions: - Data Dictionary (H) - Business Concepts (I) - Message Concepts (J) - Data Types (K) - Business Process Catalogue (L) - Financial Business Process Models (M) - Financial Business Transactions (N) 6. **Physical Message Representation (F & G -> O)** - The dictionary and schemas result in the physical messages being represented in a standardized way. 7. **ISO 20022 Compliance (P -> Q, R, E)** - Compliance with ISO 20022 impacts several financial domains such as card payments (Q) and clearing & settlement (R), while also feeding back into the creation of message models (E). 8. **Development Process (Development_Process)** - The development and registration process involves various activities with both business (T) and technical experts (U), supported by information available on the ISO 20022 website repository (V), which links back to the business process catalogue (L). Overall, the diagram describes how financial data is standardized through ISO 20022 to create a unified system of message models and dictionaries, ensuring consistent communication across the financial sector.
