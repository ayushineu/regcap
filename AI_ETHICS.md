# ü§ñ AI Ethics & Responsible Use ‚Äì RegCap GPT

RegCap GPT is an AI-powered regulatory intelligence agent designed to help users interact with and interpret complex regulatory documents such as compliance manuals, financial regulations, and privacy policies.

As the tool leverages large language models and automation for high-stakes domains like compliance and finance, we are committed to building and maintaining it with transparency, responsibility, and ethical integrity.

## üõ°Ô∏è Guiding Principles

### 1. Accuracy & Context Awareness
- Responses are generated based on semantic search across uploaded documents.
- Users are reminded that responses should be validated for legal or operational decisions.
- Diagrams and summaries are auto-generated but not a replacement for professional judgment.

### 2. Privacy & Data Handling
- RegCap GPT does not store or transmit uploaded documents beyond the user session unless explicitly configured.
- No document data is used to retrain any models or shared with third parties.

### 3. Bias Mitigation
- The underlying language model (OpenAI GPT-4o) may carry unintended biases.
- We avoid applying the tool to politically sensitive or discriminatory queries.

### 4. Responsible Deployment
- This tool is intended for **professional and educational use** only.
- Users are encouraged to consult compliance officers or legal experts before relying on responses for regulatory interpretation.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Disclaimer

RegCap GPT is not a certified legal, regulatory, or financial advisory tool.  
It is designed to **assist**, not **replace**, human expertise in regulatory analysis.  
Users must independently verify outputs for compliance-critical use cases.

## üí° Future Considerations

As the project evolves, we plan to:
- Add clearer audit trails for AI responses
- Offer configurable citation support for document-grounded queries
- Expand the ethics framework in response to user feedback and real-world applications
