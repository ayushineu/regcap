# ü§ñ AI Ethics & Responsible Use ‚Äì RegCap GPT

RegCap GPT is an AI-powered regulatory intelligence agent designed to help users interact with and interpret complex regulatory documents such as compliance manuals, financial regulations, and privacy policies.

As the tool leverages large language models and automation for high-stakes domains like compliance and finance, we are committed to building and maintaining it with transparency, responsibility, and ethical integrity.

## üõ°Ô∏è Guiding Principles

### 1. Accuracy & Context Awareness
- Responses are generated based on semantic search across uploaded documents.
- Users are reminded that responses should be validated for legal or operational decisions.
- Diagrams and summaries are auto-generated but not a replacement for professional judgment.

### 2. Privacy & Data Handling
- RegCap GPT does not store or transmit uploaded documents beyond the user session.
- All processing of regulatory documents happens securely within the application context.
- No user data is used to train or fine-tune the underlying language models.

### 3. Transparency & Attribution
- Sources of information are clearly identified in responses when possible.
- System limitations are openly communicated to users.
- The boundary between AI-generated content and document-derived content is maintained.

### 4. Bias Mitigation
- We continuously monitor for and address potential biases in regulatory interpretations.
- The system avoids making judgments on regulatory intent when ambiguous.
- Diverse regulatory contexts and frameworks are supported equally.

## üîç Implementation Practices

### Document Processing
- Text chunking is designed to preserve context and coherence
- Our vector search prioritizes relevance while maintaining document integrity
- Processing pipeline is continuously evaluated for factual preservation

### Question Answering
- Responses clearly indicate when information is limited or uncertain
- Follow-up queries are encouraged for clarification when needed
- System refrains from providing responses beyond the scope of uploaded documents

### Diagram Generation
- Visual representations simplify complex processes without omitting critical steps
- Diagram explanations accompany visuals to provide context
- Users can view the underlying diagram code for transparency

## üìã User Responsibilities

While RegCap GPT is designed to assist with regulatory understanding, users should:

1. Verify AI-generated information against authoritative sources before making decisions
2. Consider regulatory context, including jurisdiction and timeframe
3. Be aware that the tool is a decision support system, not a replacement for legal advice
4. Report any suspected inaccuracies or biases observed in system responses

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

Our ethical framework is not static. We are committed to:

- Regular reviews of system performance and ethical considerations
- Incorporating user feedback into our responsible AI practices
- Staying informed of advancements in AI ethics and regulatory technology
- Updating our practices in response to emerging ethical standards
